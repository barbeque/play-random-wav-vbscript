# Introduction
This small VBScript shows you how to randomly pick a WAV from a given directory and open it using Windows Shell (presumably then playing it).

This mostly exists in my repo partly as a favour to a friend, and partly so I have a quick reference for file manipulation using VBScript on hand.

# Operation
Use cscript.exe from the command line to run the script.

# Alterations
Knock yourself out, most variables are fairly well exposed.
